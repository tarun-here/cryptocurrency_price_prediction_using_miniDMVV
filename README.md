# Mini DMMV-Style Time Series Forecasting  

This repo is a small experiment inspired by *“Multi-Modal View Enhanced Large Vision Models for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting” (NeurIPS 2025)*.  

- **Dataset:** `crypto_prices_180days.csv` (closing prices).  
- **Notebook:** `cryptocurrency_price_prediction_using_miniDMVV.ipynb` with a BiLSTM baseline and a **DMMV-inspired model** using TrendBranch, SeasonalBranch, and FusionHead.  

**Next Steps:** extend with external signals (e.g., sentiment, multimodal features).
